/specify Build an educational web application that demonstrates the Four Color Theorem. 
The app should explain the theorem in simple terms, display curated example images (e.g. SVGs and PNGs of maps, shapes, and graphs), 
and allow users to interactively color maps and shapes to test the theorem themselves. 
Users should be able to reset, undo, and save their attempts. 
The application should also provide real-world extensions such as bivariate choropleth maps and other multivariate mapping techniques, 
with background explanations and illustrative images. 
The design should be clean, intuitive, and accessible for learners at different levels. 
The goal is to make abstract mathematical and cartographic concepts interactive, visual, and fun.
